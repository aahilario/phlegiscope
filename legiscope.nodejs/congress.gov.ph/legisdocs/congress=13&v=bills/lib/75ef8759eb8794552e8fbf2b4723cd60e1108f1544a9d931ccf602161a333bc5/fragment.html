Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular (MC) NO. 30, Series of 1991, bans public servants from smoking. Under the MC, the first violation would lead to a reprimand; a second violation, suspension; and a third violation, dismissal. However, this MC has been ignored. To put more teeth to this policy, this bill seeks to ban public officers and employees from smoking within the work premises during office hours. It proposes to impose a penalty of prision correccional or temporary disqualification from holding public office or both to any person found guilty of violating the provisions of the act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MACIAS, EMILIO II.
