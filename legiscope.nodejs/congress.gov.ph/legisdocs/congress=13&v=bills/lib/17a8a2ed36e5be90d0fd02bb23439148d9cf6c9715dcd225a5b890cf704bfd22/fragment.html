In most cases, only the productive portions of the lands were bought, leaving the landowners with unproductive and undesirable portions of the land. To redress a perceived social wrong, this bill proposes to exempt interest earnings on land bank notes paid to landowners from the payment of withholding tax.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ANGARA, JUAN EDGARDO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
