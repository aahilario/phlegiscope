Believing that agro-processors have already been covered under RA 8435, the Board of Investments excluded them from its Investment Incentive Program. The lost incentive resulted in a decline in investments in agro-processing activities.  The bill seeks to grant tariff-free importation incentive to the agricultrual and fisheries sectors.  To level the playing field for local and imported inputs and equipment, purchase of the former shall likewise be given an incentive by way of a tax credit equal to the amount of tariff that should have been paid if it were imported. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>LAPUS, JESLI A.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
