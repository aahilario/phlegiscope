Ar present, cable TV is classified under the broadcast industry although some sectors claim that it belongs to the telecommunications sector. But cable TV can neither be classified as public utility nor media. The proposed bill tries to resolve this issue by recognizing it as a separate and distinct industry meant to supplement and complement the telecommunications and broadcast sectors. The upgrading of the cable TV industry will allow for alternative modes of communication such as cable internet and cable telephony. These modes of communication will help facilitate the exchange and delivery of information in the country.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DE VENECIA, JOSE JR.
