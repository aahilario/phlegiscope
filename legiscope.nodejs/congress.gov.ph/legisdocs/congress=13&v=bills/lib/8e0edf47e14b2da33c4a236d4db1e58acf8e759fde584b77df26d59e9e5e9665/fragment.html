However, midwives and their role in the central care of women remain unrecognized and unappreciated. The bill intends to professionalize the practice of midwifery - strengthen its education and training through a revision of its standard curriculum and through a midwifery continuing education. It also provides for more work opportunities for midwives through the step-ladder approach of midwifery education.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">COMMITEE HEARINGS/ACTIONS:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
