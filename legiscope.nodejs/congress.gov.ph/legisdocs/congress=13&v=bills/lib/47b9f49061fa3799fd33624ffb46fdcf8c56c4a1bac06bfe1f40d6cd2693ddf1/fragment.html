Recent events have also proven that uncontrolled and unregulated cutting of logs is the major cause of flooding. To preserve our precious forest reserves and to avoid flooding, the bill seeks the mandatory, instead of optional,  appointment of the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Officer (PENRO) who shall ensure that the forest lands in every province are protected from wanton and illegal cutting of logs and that reforestations are undertaken in areas where needed.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DADIVAS, RODRIGUEZ D.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON 2004-07-27</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SECONDARILY REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE(S) ON APPROPRIATIONS</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
