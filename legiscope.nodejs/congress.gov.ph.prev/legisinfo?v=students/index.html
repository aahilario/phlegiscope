    <p><img src="images/govt.png" alt="signboard" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 8px;">Lawmakers in the House of Representatives are called Representatives or Congressmen/Congress-women. They are elected to a three-year term by voters in their respective legislative districts. A Representative can serve for not more than three consecutive terms. There are 243 legislative districts in the country. You live in one of these districts along with about 250,000 other people! There are 243 representatives elected by district. In addition, there are Representatives elected through the party-list system who constitute not more than twenty percent (20%) of the total number of Representatives.</p>
    <p><img src="images/steal.png" alt="thief" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-right" style="margin-left: 8px;">Lawmakers in the Senate are called Senators who are elected at large or nationwide by qualified voters to a six-year term. Senators can serve for not more than two consecutive terms. The Senate has twenty-four (24) Senators. </p>
    <p>To qualify for election as a Representative, you have to be a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter in the district in which you seek to be elected, a resident therein for not less than one (1) year before the day of the election and at least twenty-five (25) years of age. To qualify for election as a Senator, you also have to be a natural-born Filipino citizen, a registered voter, a resident of the Philippines for at least two (2) years before the day of the election and at least thirty-five (35) years old.</p>
    <p><img src="images/car.png" alt="drive a car" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 8px;">Our Constitution provides that our Congress convenes for its regular session every year beginning on the 4th Monday of July. A regular session can last until thirty days before the opening of its next regular session in the succeeding year. The President may, however, call special sessions which are usually held between regular sessions to handle emergencies or urgent matters.</p>

    <strong>LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p><strong>WHEN OUR COUNTRY WAS UNDER AMERICAN</strong> colonial rule, the legislative body was the Philippine Commission which existed from September, 1900 to October, 1907. The President of the United States appointed the members of the Philippine Commission.</p>
    <p>The Philippine Bill of 1902 mandated the creation of a bicameral or a two-chamber Philippine Legislature with the Philippine Commission as the Upper House and the Philippine Assembly as the Lower House. This bicameral legislature was inaugurated in October, 1907. Through the leadership of then Speaker Sergio Osmena and then Floor Leader Manuel Quezon, the Rules of the 59th Congress of the United States was substantially adopted as the Rules of the Philippine Legislature.</p>
    <p>In 1916, the Jones Law changed the legislative system. The Philippine Commission was abolished, and a new bicameral Philippine Legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was established.</p>
    <p>The legislative system was changed again in 1935. The 1935 Constitution established a unicameral National Assembly. But in 1940, through an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, a bicameral Congress of the Philippines consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was created.</p>
    <p>Upon the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines in 1946, Republic Act No. 6 was enacted providing that on the date of the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, the existing Congress would be known as the First Congress of the Republic.</p>
    <p>The 1973 Constitution abolished the bicameral Congress and created a unicameral Batasang Pambansa in a parliamentary system of government.</p>
    <p>The 1987 Constitution restored the presidential system of government together with a bicameral Congress of the Philippines.</p>

    <strong>NATIONAL SYMBOLS</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p><img src="images/coat-of-arms.gif" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 8px;"><strong>The National Coat of Arms</strong>. The national coat-of-arms of the Republic was approved by Commonwealth Act No. 731 on July 3, 1946. It was designed by then Captain Galo B. Ocampo, secretary of the Philippine Heraldry Committee. This was subsequently revised in February 12, 1998, under Republic Act 8491.</p>
    <p>The national coat-of-arms shall have paleways of two (2) pieces, azure and gules; a chief argent studded with three (3) mullets equidistant from each other; and, in point of honor, ovoid argent over all the sun rayonnant with eight minor lesser rays. Beneath shall be the scroll with the words "REPUBLIKA NG PILIPINAS," enscribed thereon.</p>
    <p><img src="images/flag.gif" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 8px;"><strong>The Flag of the Republic of the Philippines</strong>. The Philippine flag stands for unity and national identity, and expresses the Filipino's aspirations for freedom, equality, justice and nobility. It is the only flag in the world able to signify peace or war. In time of peace, the blue stripe is on top of the red. In time of war, the red stripe is on top of the blue. </p>
    <p>The red stripe symbolizes courage and the willingness of every Filipino to shed blood in defense of our country, while the blue stripe stands for peace and unity among all Filipinos.</p>
    <p>The equilateral triangle on the left side is symbolic of equality among men. The eight rays of the Philippine Sun in the triangle represent the eight provinces that first revolted against Spanish rule. The three stars on each corner of the triangle stand for Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. </p>
    <p><img src="images/hreplogo.png" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 8px;"><strong>The Seal of the House of Representatives. </strong>On September 23, 2015, the House of Representatives adopted a new seal through House Resolution No. 233 which is reflective of the character and tradition of the institution.</p>

    <p>The Seal is in circular form with the National Coat-of-Arms of the Republic of the Philippines but without the scroll and the inscription in the center.</p>

    <p>The year "1907" is incribed below the escutcheon representing the year the First Philippine Assembly was inaugurated. Eighty-one (81) Stars surround and guide the blazon representing the current number of provinces comprising the Republic.</p>

    <p>Surrounding the whole is a double marginal circle within which appears the words "House of Representatives" in the upper part, and "Philippines" in the lower part. These phrases are separated by two small five-pointed stars.</p>

    <strong>CONTACTING YOUR REPRESENTATIVE</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>You have a very important role in the making of our laws. You may not be able to vote for our local and national leaders until you are 18 years old, but as a citizen, you can contact your Representatives to let them know what you think and how you feel about existing and proposed laws, or your suggestions for new laws needed to make our lives and our society better.</p>
    <p>Your Representatives enjoy hearing from young people like you. One of the best ways to be heard is to <a href="../members">email your Representative</a> through their profile page on our website.</p>
    <p>You may also contact your Representatives by calling the trunkline of the House of Representatives at Tel. No. 8931-5001. An operator will connect you to the office of the Representative you wish to contact. You may use the same telephone number to get in touch with offices of the House Secretariat for any assistance on legislative matters you may need.</p>
    <p>We also encourage you to personally visit your House of Representatives. We can arrange a fun and interesting tour for your group, class, organization or school throughout the year. Contact us in advance for tour arrangements at Tel. No. 8931-5001.</p>
