These incidents have shaken the very foundation of the Torrens System of land titling.  This bill seeks to amend the Insurance Code by creating the field of land title insurance.  Title insurance protects whoever is dealing with land titles from any loss which may be incurred should the title later on turn out to be fraudulent or fake.  With the introduction of this insurance, those who transact in real estate are compelled to declare the true value of their transaction.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>LAPUS, JESLI A.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
