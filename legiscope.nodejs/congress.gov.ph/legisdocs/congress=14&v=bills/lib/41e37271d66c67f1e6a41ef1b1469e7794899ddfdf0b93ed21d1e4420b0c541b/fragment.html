Providing the views of the Department of Health (DOH) on the bills was Dr. Robert Louie So, Head Executive Assistant, Office of the Secretary who testifiedthat branded drugs have maintained their edge over unbranded pharmaceutical products, with sales reaching more than sixty-three (63) billion pesos at the end of 2002.

To address the issue of unbranded drugs continue to register a negative growth rate of five percent (5%), with a lower value of sales at P2.4 billion in 2002 compared to P2.6 billion in 2001, Dr. So stated the DOH has come up with some proposals. One of these recommendations, i.e. the Intellectual property Code of the Philippines is to amend RA 8293 to incorporate the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Flexibilities. He explained that the TRIPS Flexibilities was conceived to allow governments of developing countries to adopt measures to promote and protect public health and public interest and to prevent the abuse of intellectual property rights. Another proposal, he added, is the strengthening of the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) and the amendment of the Generics Act of 1998. (Republic Act No. 6675)

On the other hand, Rep. Locsin suggested that Members can refer to the issues discussed and raised on the subject matter during the Thirteenth Congress in order to speed up the disposition of the bills currently being considered by the Committee. However, Rep. Milagros �Mitos� Magsaysay remarked that all members especially neophyte legislators must be given the chance to study and comment on the measures filed under the current Congress.

Meanwhile, the Chairman pointed out that the body will exert its best efforts to address all issues and concerns regarding the said proposals.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Under deliberation by the Mother Committee on 2007-09-19</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-19 September 2007 Dr. So resumed his presentation of the DOH�s position on the various bills filed before the Committee as to the general overview of the supply and demand for pharmaceuticals, the national drug policy, policy reforms as well as some of their recommendations on how to address the high cost of medicine. The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) through its representative, Mr. Epifanio M. Evasco, Director, Bureau of Patents � IPO, briefed the Committee on the proposed amendments to the Intellectual Property Code to promote public health as well as their recommendations. Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI) Assistant Secretary Ma. Lourdes Baua manifested that the DTI has submitted its position paper to the Committee as well as their comments on the issues such as parallel importations, early working provisions, creation of Drug Price Regulation Board, non-discriminatory clause and proposed amendments to the Generics Law, among others. Atty. Ulysses Gallego, Consultant, Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) and PITC Pharma, Inc. presented a general picture of the pharmaceutical market, its supply system, comparative prices of some medicine from select Asian countries, the implementation of the government program to reduce the high price of medicine, particularly the Botika ng Barangay at Botika ng Bayan, and other interventions along this line including parallel importation. Health Watch, through its President, Mr. Roberto Pagdanganan, a non-governmental organization composed of representatives of manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, health care providers and other stakeholders in the healthcare industry submitted to the Committee their position paper on the early working doctrine, parallel drug importation, �new use� provision, proposed amendments to the Generics Law, �must carry� provisions and the creation of a Drug Price Regulatory Board.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Under deliberation by the Mother Committee on 2007-09-20</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-20 September 2007 The Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP) affirmed that it supports the concept of improving access to high quality, affordable medicines by the public as well as to improve the general healthcare situation of the country Mr. Eufe Tantia, PHAP Assistant Vice President, stated that many of PHAP�s member companies have in fact introduced lines of low-priced medicines and established medication programs that aim to make long-term medication more available while at the same time maintaining the highest quality standards to ensure that such medicines are safe and effective. Likewise, the PHAP advocates the full implementation of the Generics Act and the efforts to strengthen the capability of local generic manufacturers to provide alternative high quality and low cost medicines to Filipinos, subject to the best judgment of their doctors on appropriate therapies. It also encourages initiatives that will develop the local industry and expand its capability to increase local manufacture not only of high quality finished products, but also of raw materials which in the long run will lead to the improvement in the exports industry and eventually to advantageous economies of scale for the Philippine pharmaceutical industry. However, the PHAP maintains that improving access to high quality affordable medicines is only a small part of the larger challenge of improving access to healthcare in the Philippines. Putting the patient at the center is key. An assessment of gaps in the critical elements of the total healthcare system including infrastructure, clinicians, regulatory, insurance system funding design, healthcare worker retention, and even education will go along way toward building a stronger and more sustainable healthcare policy. More specifically, the role of various stakeholders such as doctors, pharmacists, nurses, retailers, and manufacturers of generic and innovator products will have to be recognized. Moreover, Mr. Tantia warned that if uncontrolled, parallel importation may compromise the safety and potency of medicines if transported or stored improperly and under wrong temperature and humidity conditions. It may also lead to the proliferation of counterfeit medicines. Parallel imports from proposed South Asian countries are likely to be sourced from overseas consolidators, and its active pharmaceutical ingredients will, in most cases, originate from countries where counterfeiting is prevalent and where distribution conditions are not optimal for safety. Furthermore, parallel importation will undermine the goal of developing the local industry. Mr. Tantia asserted that a survey of the prices of products that are currently being parallel imported would clearly show that the same are even a lot higher than the prices of the generic alternatives that are available in the market. Nevertheless, the PHAP favors the Bolar type (i.e. early working doctrine) exception, specifically that which is similar to the Singapore model. It however wishes to emphasize its concerns with regard to other proposed amendments to the Intellectual Property (IP) Code, given that a strong patent protection is fundamental in motivating players in any industry to allocate resources to new discoveries. In conclusion, the PHAP recommends that further examination, discussion and scrutiny on the pending pieces of legislation that affects IP rights be done before they are passed. On the other hand, Ms. Malou Buensuceso, President of the Philippine Chamber of the Pharmaceutical Industry (PCPI), bared that the PCPI deems that the proposed amendments to the IP Code is the focal and most viable option in making medicines more affordable and accessible and thus should be deliberated ahead of the other legislative alternatives. Likewise, she called on the government to consider the grant of incentives to local drug manufacturers to make them more competitive and to level the playing field. Ms. Celia Carlos, National Affairs Committee Chairperson of the Drugstores Association of the Philippines (DSAP), declared its solidarity with the general public in its clamor for cheaper medicines aimed at alleviating the health of the people and giving them the opportunity to enjoy better quality of life. In this regard, the DSAP supports the bills intended to amend the IP Code that includes: i. early working provisions that will pave the way for easier manufacturing of out-of-patent drugs and importation of parallel pharmaceutical products, thus enhancing competition in the market which will hopefully bring down medicine prices; ii. creation of non-patentable invention which will prevent abuse of �evergreening� patents, paving the way for the manufacture of equivalent generic products; and iii. compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical products when public interest is at stake. Likewise, the DSAP favors the strengthening of the implementation of the Generics Law. Putting more teeth to the sanctions in cases of violation in the compliance of the Generics Act will help boost the implementation of the 19 year old law. In addition, the DSAP believes that price regulation must be imposed on the manufacturers and distributors end. Transfer pricing, royalties and licensing fees from multinational corporations to its local subsidiaries must be the ones regulated. This can be done by formulating a reference pricing scheme based on international marketing data. Instead of indicating suggested retail prices (SRPs) on labels of every product, it would be wiser to simply post and publish reference pricing of essential products. In contrast, local generic products must be exempted from price regulation as these are by far already low in terms of prices. Moreover, Ms. Carlos maintained that the DSAP finds the must-carry provision for parallel imports a safety risk and economically unviable for small drugstores. Allowing freely the loading of stocks of parallel imports to all drugstore outlets without selective accreditation may be used as a shield for those unregistered imported medicines classified under Philippine laws as counterfeit. Also, most drugstores in the country with limited capital would prefer carrying on their shelves only saleable items. Forcing them to shell out capital for non-moving items may mean waste of valuable capital that will burden their operation. Furthermore, the DSAP proposes additional measures to lower medicine such as support for the development of indigenous sources of medicines; regulation of pharmaceutical product advertisements, more particularly those with no therapeutic claim, and sales promotion; support for the Filipino manufacturers of generic or alternative brand products; promotion of rational drug use; and passage of the bill strengthening the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD). The Cut the Cost, Cut the Pain Network, otherwise known as 3CPNet, also endorsed the passage of the bills that seek to avail of the flexibilities i.e. parallel importation, compulsory licensing, early working provisions, etc. - provided for under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (GATT-TRIPS). Speaking on behalf of 3CPNet, Dr. Aurora Parong also suggested cost-containment measures which include setting up a reference pricing system for each cluster of drugs; bulk purchasing to include the Department of Health (DoH) and other national government institutions and the local government units to increase the government�s negotiating leverage; and tax reforms such as the removal of e-VAT for medicines. Other measures which the 3CPNet are pursuing in relation to the Access to Medicines Framework of the World Health Organization (WHO) include amending the Generics Act, whereby doctors shall be prohibited from indicating brands in their prescriptions; and Rational Drug Use wherein independent drug information on the PNDF (handbook) shall be given to physicians, medical students, pharmacists and drug dispensing facilities, and massive information and education with reference to generics, essential drugs and pricing of medicines shall be implemented at the grassroots level. In the ensuing deliberations, Rep. Eduardo Zialcita queried on whether it would be more expedient to enforce and strengthen the Price Act in lieu of establishing a Drug Price Regulation Board. Also, he opined that distributors, and not manufacturers, should be punished for pricing drugs and medicines very high. During the same hearing, Rep. Ferjenel Biron presented samples of specific drugs and medicine brands which were sold in India and Thailand at prices that were, in some cases, only one-tenth of the price these same pharmaceutical products were retailed domestically. In asking why such price disparity exists, Rep. Biron underscored that the prices of active ingredients in pharmaceutical products are uniform regardless of the manufacturing site or location. As to the marketing activities of local drug firms, he noted that it is common knowledge that pharmaceutical companies do sponsor the trips of doctors and even their families to overseas conventions.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Under deliberation by the Mother Committee on 2007-09-24</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-24 September 2007 Dr. Rene B. Azurin, Professor of the University of the Philippines Graduate School of Business, expressed reluctance regarding the provision in some of the Bills that proposed the creation of a drug prices regulation board. He explained that such a regulatory board would work contrary to the intention of lowering the drug prices since it would only serve the interests of the big pharmaceutical firms, considering their huge resources to undertake lobbying, rather protect the public interest. He called the attention to the idea of the economist George Stigler called �regulatory capture� or �the effective takeover by regulated entities of control of their regulating body.� He affirmed that for as long as the big drug firms are �able to control the supply of drugs in this market, they can dictate the prices. Limit the supply to a level below the actual need and demand will force its prices up, regulation board or no regulation board.� He mentioned the World Health Organization (WHO), which upheld that based on experiences of other countries, it was found out �that price controls have no leverage, (are) difficult to sustain� and hard to implement.� According to him, the simpler and more straightforward approach would be to expand supply through parallel importation of drugs from abroad such as from India and Pakistan. He said that the importation of patented drugs from countries, where they are being sold by patent holders or their licensees more cheaply than they are sold in the Philippines, is one of the flexibilities in the WTO�s (World Trade Organization) TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement. He observed that our existing patent law is �overly protective of their patent rights and afford them even greater protection than we are actually required to provide under WTO agreements.� Ms. Elmira. Bacatan, Campaigns Officer, Oxfam stated that her organization supports the amendments incorporating the TRIPS flexibilities. She mentioned that the TRIPS Agreement does not define the scope of patentability but instead left it to the discretion of member-countries to define and determine. The same agreement allowed the placement of limitation on patent rights so as to allow importation of patented drugs and medicines and this flexibility is reaffirmed in 2001 under the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, which stated that each country is �free to establish its own regime for such exhaustion without challenge.� She made several recommendations: (1) the replacement of non-patentability provision with the mention of the effective disallowance of any patent for second uses or second indications of old medicines, and not to grant a patent to those second uses that provide an enhancement of known efficacy; (2) the adoption of the broader Kenyan provision which allow the importation of any product put on the market legitimately, including those products placed under compulsory license; (3) the deletion of provisions which espouse data exclusivity thereby preventing early working on patented provision, and thus preventing the entry of affordable generic versions of medicines; (4) the strengthening of the government-use provision of the Intellectual Property (IP) Code through the adoption of a broader provision which permits government the manufacture of patented drugs without the authorization from the patent holder, thus introducing generic competition or inducing the patent holder to reduce the price of medicines. Ms. Paula Mae Tanquieng, Advocacy Officer, Ayos Na Gamot sa Abot-Kayang Presyo Coalition (AGAP) observed that the current IP Code bars meaningful competition in the pharmaceutical industry. AGAP strongly agrees with the provisions of majority of the bills that provides for TRIPS flexibilities, in particular: the inclusion of the prohibition against �new use� provision; the early-working doctrine or �Bolar Provision�; the principle of �international exhaustion� or that which allows parallel importation; the government use provision which allows the government or any authorized third person to exploit the invention of a drug or medicine without agreement of the patent owner during national emergency or other cases of extreme urgency. However, AGAP expressed its reservations as to the inclusion of a non-discriminatory clause and the creation of a drug price regulation board.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Under deliberation by the Mother Committee on 2007-09-25</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-25 September 2007 Dr. Socorro Escalante, Programs Officer for Essential Drugs &amp; Medicines Program of the World Health Organization (WHO) presented the mechanism of price control, its impact into the prices of medicines and the difficulty of establishing the fair price. However, WHO expressed its adverse opinion in controlling prices through this mode, as the same is difficult to sustain. In this regard, Dr. Escalante submitted that cost-containment mechanism is a better option in lowering down prices as the same provides for professional intervention and strategies, intervention targeting, reimbursement measures, public education and structural procurement among other access. Dr. Escalante further proposed that the Philippines should consider the strengthening of the Generics Act, the reference pricing system, and taking full advantage of the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights) flexibilities. The Philippine Medical Association (PMA) through Dr. Romeo Encanto, Chairman, Committee on Legislation stressed its full endorsement of all measures reducing the prices of medicines. It supports the amendment of RA 8293 (Intellectual Property Code) and the Generics Act. It supports parallel importation, compulsory licensing and the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement as it guarantees the rights of member countries to formulate and implement its own public health policies. The PMA further cited the factors which have contributed to the soaring prices of medicines and presented recommendations to at least manage the problem. It however, presented its opposition on some provisions of the Cheaper Medicine Bills, particularly that which increases the penalty on medical practitioners in violation of the Generics Act, the dispensing prohibition and the �no substitution� prescription provision. Atty. Leo Olarte, M.D., testified that the Philippine Hospitals Association (PHA) supports the views of the PMA. He stressed the need for the effective implementation of the cost-containment mechanism and the review of the taxing policy of the government on medicines Dr. Gene Alzonz Nisperos, Secretary General of the Health Alliance for Democracy (HEAD) explained the extent of monopoly of the local drug industry by trans-and multi-national corporations, which led to monopoly pricing worsened by lack of regulation and monitoring, inadequacy of health policies and the absence of a national drug industry. To regulate prices of medicines, HEAD proposes selective parallel importation, compulsory licensing, direct price regulation, the creation of a transitory drug price regulatory board, incentives for Filipino drug manufacturers, strengthening of the Generics Act and the implementation of a national drug policy. Dr. Edelina de la Paz, spokesperson of the Kilos Bayan Para sa Kalusugan (KBK), attributed the high prices of medicines to the multi-national drug firms and the failure to implement national drug policies. To address the problem, the KBK proposes the development of a self-reliant national drug industry, as well as the development of technology to refine and extract raw materials and tap indigenous and herbal plants.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-val/raffy, please change inputs under "action" column- all entries state "first meeting" on all dates. also, all the other related bills should likewise be updated. thanks. lina</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
