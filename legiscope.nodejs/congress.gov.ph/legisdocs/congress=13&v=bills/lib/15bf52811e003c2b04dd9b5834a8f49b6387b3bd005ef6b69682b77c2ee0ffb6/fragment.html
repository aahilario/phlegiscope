The provision is viewed to be onerous since it dislocates their families, affects the schooling of their children and entails additional expenses in establishing a new residence. This bill seeks to delete Section 44and revert back to Article 7, Section 56 of the Omnibus Election Code as the operative rule governing the reassignment of elections officers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ZAMORA, MANUEL "WAY KURAT" E.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS : </td></tr><tr><td width="33%">1.
