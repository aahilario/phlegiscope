Financial institutions accept only Certificate of Land Titles as collateral for loans. The Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) given by the Department of Agrarian Reform to amortizing farmers are proof that they are beneficiaries of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). However, since CLOAs are not yet Certificates of Land Titles, financial institutions are reluctant to grant loans to beneficiaries of the CARP. The bill seeks to authorize financial institutions to accept CLOAs issued under the CARP as collateral for loans. Granting farmers access to financial institutions will surely promote an increase in agricultural production.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DE VENECIA, JOSE JR.
