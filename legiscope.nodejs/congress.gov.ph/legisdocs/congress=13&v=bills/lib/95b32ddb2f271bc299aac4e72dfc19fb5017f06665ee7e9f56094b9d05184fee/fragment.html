Many have resorted to becoming informal settlers, turning blind eyes to the dangers posed to their children in such communities. This bill seeks to provide some measure of relief to our taxpayers who are married or heads of their families, by including their rentals as allowable deductions from their gross income. It is envisioned that the said amount shall be used to provide for other equally important needs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BIAZON, ROZZANO RUFINO B.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
