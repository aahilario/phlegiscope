It is, however, silent as to whether the official, who is next in line of succession, can fill the very same vacant position he is prohibited by law to serve beyond three consecutive terms. The bill seeks to amend the aforementioned provision to provide a crystal clear mandate on succession by prohibiting certain local officials, who are disqualified by law to service during the prohibitive term, to fill permanent vacancies in elected positions covered by the prohibition. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MACIAS, EMILIO II.
