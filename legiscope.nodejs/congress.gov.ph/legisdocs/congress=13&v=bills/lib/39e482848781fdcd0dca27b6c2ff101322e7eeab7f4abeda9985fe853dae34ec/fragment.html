Young as they are, the SKs perform their tasks with unwavering idealism, vigor and dedication. The other reality, however, is that most SKs are also students and unemployed. The honoraria and other allowances that they receive from the local governments are barely adequate to support the various programs and activities they they undertake.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>UMALI, AURELIO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION ON 2005-02-14</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PREVIOUS COMMITTEE REFERRALS :PRIMARILY REFERRED TO TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS on 2004-07-28;</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
