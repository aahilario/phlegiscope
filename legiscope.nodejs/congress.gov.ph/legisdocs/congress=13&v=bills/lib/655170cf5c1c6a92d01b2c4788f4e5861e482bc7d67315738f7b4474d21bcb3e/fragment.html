</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">ABSTRACT : The use of the words "Muslim" and "Islamic" in association with suspected or criminal and unalawful acts are offensively biased against Muslims. This practice is highly prejudicial and extremely injurious to the Islamic religious culture and to Muslim individuals. This measure prohibits the use of the word "Muslim" or "Islamic" in print, television and other forms of broadcast media to refer to or to describe any person convicted of a crime or suspected of committing any unlawful act. The outlawing of this biased practice would definitely help lessen enmity between Muslims and non-Muslims. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ANGARA, JUAN EDGARDO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
