The funds are held in trust by the OWWA to be utilized, theoretically, on programs and investments favorable to OFWs.  However, information has filtered out that the OWWA has been transacting unfavorably to the welfare of OFWs.  This bill provides for greater participation by OFWs in the administration and management of their funds.  It also seeks to require the prior approval of OFWs in the utilization of OWWA funds.  </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
