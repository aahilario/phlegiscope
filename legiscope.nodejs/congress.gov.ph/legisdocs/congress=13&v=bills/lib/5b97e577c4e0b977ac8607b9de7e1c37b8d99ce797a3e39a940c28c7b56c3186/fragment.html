These three functions are now quite irrelevant in the case of septuagenarians detained in prison.  Their reformation and rehabilitaion would be of no value to themselves, their family and even to society if they are not given a chance to live with their families.  Considering their age and mounting mental, physical and emotional incapacity, the bill seeks to make eligible for parole prisoners who are 75 years of age or above, notwithstanding the minimum penalty imposed upon them.  </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">MOTHER BILL:&nbsp;HB05881</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF LAWS ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
