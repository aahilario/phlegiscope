At present, the said law only allows the exemption on condition that the imported agriculture supplies shall be used exclusively by the importing enterprise, i.e. the importers cannot sell these products to small farmers, fishers, cooperatives and other members of the agriculture and fisheries sector. Furthermore, the latter can not import directly because only business enterprises, not individuals, are allowed to import under the AFMA. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DADIVAS, RODRIGUEZ D.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
