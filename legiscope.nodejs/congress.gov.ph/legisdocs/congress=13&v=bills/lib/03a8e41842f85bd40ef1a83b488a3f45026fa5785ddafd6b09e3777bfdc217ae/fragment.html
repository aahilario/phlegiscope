To ensure that his authority and responsibility are distinct, the measure proposes to create the rank of First Chief Master Sergeant/First Master Chief Petty Officer (E-10) for the enlisted personnel with the highest rank in both position and grade to be held by the AFP Command Sergeant Major. The bill will also rationalize the pay grade of both the officers' corps and the enlisted personnel.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BIAZON, ROZZANO RUFINO B.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
