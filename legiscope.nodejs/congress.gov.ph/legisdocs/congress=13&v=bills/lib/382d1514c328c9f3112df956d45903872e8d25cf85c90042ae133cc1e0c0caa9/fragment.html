The proposed reallocation will not only correct the disparity that LGUs suffer from the added cost of maintaining devolved responsibilities but it will erase the apparent mismatch between the allocation of the IRA shares and the distribution of the financial burden as a direct consequence of devolution.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ANGARA, JUAN EDGARDO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
