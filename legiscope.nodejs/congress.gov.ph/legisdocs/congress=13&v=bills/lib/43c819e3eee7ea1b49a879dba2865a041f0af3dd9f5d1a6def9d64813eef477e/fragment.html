The bill seeks to do declare all elective officials running for any office other than one he is holding in a permanent capacity as ipso facto resigned from his office upon filing of the certificate of candidacy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DADIVAS, RODRIGUEZ D.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON SUFFRAGE AND ELECTORAL REFORMS ON 2004-07-28</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
