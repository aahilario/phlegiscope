Ten years after the passage of RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act), the lack of decent and affordable housing facilities remains to be one of the most pervasive socio-economic problems of the country. This bill seeks to create the Department of Housing and Urban Development that will be responsible for the management of housing and urban development. It aims to streamline the different housing agencies and corporations thereby integrating all housing and urban development polices, plans and programs within the purview of expediting the delivery of decent, affordable and sustainable housing and urban development plans.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DADIVAS, RODRIGUEZ D.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
