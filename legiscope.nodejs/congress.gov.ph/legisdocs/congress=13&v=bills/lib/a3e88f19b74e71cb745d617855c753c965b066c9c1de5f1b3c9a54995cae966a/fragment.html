This would deter elective officials from accepting offers to assume another position caused by vacancies or resignations of certain officials.  Elected officials who assume vacancies in other posts in the government, in effect, abandon the mandate of the people who elected them.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BIAZON, ROZZANO RUFINO B.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
