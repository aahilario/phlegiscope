Violence against women has a devastating effect on the physical and emotional well-being not only of the victim but also the people around them as well as future generation. To address this concern, the bill seeks to mandate that basic self-defense techniques be taught to enable females to protect themselves in the event of imminent danger. Equipping women with self-defense techniques will also address another sensitive issue - heinous crimes.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON WOMEN ON 2004-07-27</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SECONDARILY REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE(S) ON APPROPRIATIONS</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
