It is believed that if the national government were to impose the idle land tax, local officials will most likely implement the same. The bill seeks to provide for the imposition by the national government of a 10% idle land tax based on the zonal value or the fair market value of the land, whichever is higher.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON 2004-07-27</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SECONDARILY REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE(S) ON WAYS AND MEANS</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
