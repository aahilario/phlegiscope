Resident aliens of foreign countries are deemed incapable of placing 100% devotion to the interest and welfare of their homeland since they must also see to their duties as permanent residents of that country. The bill seeks to amend the Civil Service Decree of the Philippines with a provision that no person who is permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country shall be eligible for appointment to any public office. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
