However, said section also provides that the share of the national government from the community tax collection shall be remitted by the city or municipality concerned within 10 days after the end of each quarter. It is silent as to when the barangay shall receive its share. To correct this situation, the bill proposes to amend the LGC by allowing the barangay treasurer to automatically retain the 50% share of the barangay in the community tax collection and to remit the share of the city or municipality within 10 days after the end of each month. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
