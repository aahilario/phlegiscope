Unfortunately, the teaching profession is among the lowest income earning professions.  As a result, many qualified teachers often seek employment abroad.  This bill seeks to exempt from the payment of income taxes the first three years salary of school teachers.  The incentive will not only help solve the problem on teacher shortage but it will also help to improve the quality of elementary and high school education in public and private schools.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>LAPUS, JESLI A.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
