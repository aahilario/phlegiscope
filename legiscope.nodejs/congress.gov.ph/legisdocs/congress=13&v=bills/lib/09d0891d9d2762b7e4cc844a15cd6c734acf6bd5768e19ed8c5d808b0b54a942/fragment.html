Subjecting such compensation to any form of tax would constitute a travesty of justice for such is not income. At most, such compensation will only be rehabilitative or restorative but it will never approximate the depth and magnitude of the injury or suffering of human rights victims. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>JARAULA, CONSTANTINO G.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
