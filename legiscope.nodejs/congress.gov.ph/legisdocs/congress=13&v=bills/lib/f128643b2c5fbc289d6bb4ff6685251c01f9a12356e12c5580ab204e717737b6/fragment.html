The bill seeks to provide additional benefits to members of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) who are not covered under RA 9166 in view of its transfer as an attached agency of the Department of Transporation and Communications (DOTC). The PCG's transfer to the DOTC enhances the PCG's unique status as a uniformed commissioned service operating outside the military organization and working under the umbrella of a civilian department thus placing it in a category of its own.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BIAZON, ROZZANO RUFINO B.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
