The bill seeks to grant senior citizens a 20% discount on the purchase of funeral services (on the pre-need basis) to lessen the burden of the family left behind by the elderly when he passes on. It further proposes the establishment of an Office of the Senior Citizen Affairs (OSCA) in the Office of the Governor and City Mayor to be headed by a provincial board member and city councilor, respectively. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
