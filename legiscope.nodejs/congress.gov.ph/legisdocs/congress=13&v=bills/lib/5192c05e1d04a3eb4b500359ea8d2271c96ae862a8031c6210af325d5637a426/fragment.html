The Constitution provides for the State to "assign the highest budgetary priority to education and ensure that teaching will attract and retain its rightful share of the best available talents through adequate remuneration and other means of job satisfaction and fulfillment". Despite the above, the welfare of the teachers remain neglected. This measure proposes additional incentive to public school teachers who are assigned to towns other than their own town but within the same province. Those who are assigned to towns of other provinces shall be entitled to more incentives under the proposed bill. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ANGARA, JUAN EDGARDO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
