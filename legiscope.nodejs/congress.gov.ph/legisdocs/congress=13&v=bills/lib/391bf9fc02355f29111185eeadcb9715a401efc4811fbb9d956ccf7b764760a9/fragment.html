The bill seeks to put a stop to this and to ensure that henceforth all benefits and privileges accorded to public service workers by law and by Executive Orders, Memorandum Orders, Memorandum Circulars and other administrative issuances would be enjoyed by them without any problem.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
