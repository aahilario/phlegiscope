A guard who frees an inmate not only participates post litem to the commission of the crime but also turns traitor to the government. This bill seeks to define the crime of betrayal of duty in the custody of prisoners and impose stiffer penalties on officials who betray their duty as caretakers of prisoners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BATERINA, SALACNIB F.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
