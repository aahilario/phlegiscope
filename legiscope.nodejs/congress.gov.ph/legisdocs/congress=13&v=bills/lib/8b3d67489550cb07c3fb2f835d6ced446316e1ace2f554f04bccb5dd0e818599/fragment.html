Statistics show that the number of women employed in country has increased by 51% from 1980 to 2001.  To further increase women's work-participation  rate and to channel female labor into genuinely productive tasks, this bill seeks to delete Section 130 and 131 of the Labor Code which prohibit women from rendering nighwork.  Such prohibition is prejudicial to women workers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
