The bill seeks to remedy the situation by decriminalizing violations to Sections 98 and 99 of the Omnibus Election Code.  Nevertheless, it imposes on persons who violate these sections administrative fines similar to those provided in Section 14 of RA 7166 which are imposed on candidates and political parties who fail to file a report on campaign contributions and expenditures. In addition to the fines, a contributor who fails to comply with Sections 98 and 99 will not be able to claim exemption from donor's tax.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-12</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">MOTHER BILL:&nbsp;HB05877</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON SUFFRAGE AND ELECTORAL REFORMS ON 2004-08-02</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
