About 20% of the country's total labor force are not covered by any form of retirement plan. Savings account cannot be depended upon to provide financial security to those not covered by retirement plans. Moreover, retirement or pension plans offered by pre-need companies are too expensive. A savings scheme is needed to encourage Filipinos to save for their retirement years. The bill provides for the establishment of a provident equity retirement account (PERA) which is a form of savings scheme that help improve the country's saving rate. It proposes to make contributions to the PERA 100% deductible from the taxable income of the contributor.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DE VENECIA, JOSE JR.
