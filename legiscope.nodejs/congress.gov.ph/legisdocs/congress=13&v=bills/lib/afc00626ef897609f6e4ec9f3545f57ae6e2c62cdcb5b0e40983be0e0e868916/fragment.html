Had these lands been utilized, agricultural productivity and food security would not be a critical problem today. This measure seeks to increase the ceiling of the tax on idle lands from 5% to 10% to give local government units more flexibility in its imposition. The current maximum tax of 5% has not proven to be an effective deterrent against the non-utilization of agricultural lands for productive purposes.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
