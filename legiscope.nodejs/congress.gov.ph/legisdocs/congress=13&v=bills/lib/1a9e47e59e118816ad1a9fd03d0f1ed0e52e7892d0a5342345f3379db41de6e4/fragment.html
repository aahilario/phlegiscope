The proposed bill seeks to prohibit the practice of recruitment and placement agencies to blacklist "undesirable" overseas Filipino workers (OFWa) by any means  to prevent or deter them from further gaining productive employment abroad. The process of blacklisting in the labor industry, especially among seafarers, through whatever mode, is violative of the 1987 Constitution and the Labor Code. The bill pursues to penalize any recruitment and placement agency that requires, as a condition of employment or reemployment, an OFW to refrain from lodging any protest, complaint or any similar mode of expression of one's grievance.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BARINAGA, ROSELLER L.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
