The measure seeks to impose a period within which substitution may be effected. It proposes to require the substitute candidate to file his certificate of candidacy not later than 30 days before election day. It also pushes for the automatic relinquishment of office upon filing  of certificate of candidacy of any elective official running for any office, including for President or Vice President, other than the one which he/she is holding in a permanent capacity.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON SUFFRAGE AND ELECTORAL REFORMS ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
