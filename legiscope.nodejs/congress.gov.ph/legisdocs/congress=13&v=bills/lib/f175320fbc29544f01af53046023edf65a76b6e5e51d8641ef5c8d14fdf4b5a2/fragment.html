Information technology (IT) and related industries have given direct employment to thousands of our countrymen.  Unfortunately, theft and pilferage of this industry's products have been on the rise because of the relative ease in which these products can be taken out because of their miniature size and a high value. The measure seeks to declare as unlawful for any person to tkae, pilfer or steal, with intent to gain, any material, article, equipment or by-products manufactured, produced, owned or belonging to IT enterprises in special economic zones.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>REMULLA, GILBERT C.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
