The measure seeks to change the title from "Prison Guard" to "Corrections Officer" attached to the ranks of the Custodial Force of the Bureau of Corrections and to adjust their salary grades accordingly. Department Circular No. 39, issued by the Secretary of Justice, renamed the Bureau of Prisons to the present Bureau of Corrections to conform to ongoing trends in modern penology - shifting from antiquated punitive system of incarceration to the humanistic rehabilitation approach. The same principle is also applied in the bill. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>BIAZON, ROZZANO RUFINO B.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE ON 2004-11-08</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SECONDARILY REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE(S) ON APPROPRIATIONS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PREVIOUS COMMITTEE REFERRALS :PRIMARILY REFERRED TO PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY on 2004-07-27;</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
