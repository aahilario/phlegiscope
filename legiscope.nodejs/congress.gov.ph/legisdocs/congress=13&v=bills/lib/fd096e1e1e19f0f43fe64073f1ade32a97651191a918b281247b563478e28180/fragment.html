In most cases, the tendency of the victim is not to report the incident or file charges against her parent who raped her because the penalty is death.  This bill seeks to lower the penalty on incestuous rape from death to reclusion perpetua to encourage  victims to report the incident, file appropriate charges and testify in court.  </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF LAWS ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
