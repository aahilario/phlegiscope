The cancellations occur mainly because the subject pieces of land were erroneously covered by the program. This bill seeks to reaffirm that EPSs and CLOAs are land titles under PD 1527. The measure provides for compensation to landowners whose lands were erroneously covered by the land reform program. It ensures that the farmer-beneficiaries do not bear the consequences of the Department of Agrarian Reform's errors in distributing lands that should have been exempted from the coverage of the program. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ZAMORA, MANUEL "WAY KURAT" E.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
