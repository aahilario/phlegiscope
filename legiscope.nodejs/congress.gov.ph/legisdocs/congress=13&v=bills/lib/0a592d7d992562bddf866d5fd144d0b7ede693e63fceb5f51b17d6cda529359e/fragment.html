Teachers are the single most important factor in education. However, because of their not-so-attractive remuneration, teaching is perceived as a poorly esteemed profession that can not attract the best minds. This bill seeks to improve the plight of teachers by improving the benefits afforded to them to encourage the best minds to join the teaching profession. Specifically, this provides additional insurance benefits to teachers, over and above the benefits given by the Government Service Insurance System.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ANGARA, JUAN EDGARDO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
