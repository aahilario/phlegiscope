Under deliberation by the Mother Committee on 2011-05-17</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Rep. Teodoro apprised the Body that a similar bill was filed and approved by the House and was transmitted to the Senate in the 14th Congress.  However, due to lack of material time because of the onset of the national elections, Senate was not able to approve the Committee Report for HB 5947, hence the re-filing of the same proposal in the 15th Congress.  

He stressed that the bill does not propose for additional remuneration of Supervisors rather, it proposes to strengthen the role of the schools district Supervisor as head of the Schools District by proposing that the position be considered as a separate level in the organizational structure of the Department of Education (DepEd), and not as a staff of another unit or level.  The bill also intends to expand the duties and responsibilities of School District Supervisors, such as:

•To provide professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and   learning centers in the district or cluster.

•To support the implementation of the curriculum and other academic-related programs prescribed by the DepEd.

•To provide technical assistance to school heads to support compliance to various administrative responsibilities.

•To monitor the formulation of school improvement plans and consolidate funding requirements of programs and projects to be presented to the municipal school board.

•To undertake advocacy work directed at encouraging Local Government Units and non-government organizations to implement alternative learning system and alternative delivery mode, adopt-a-school, library hub and other programs that seek participation and support.

Agreement reached:
Committee will await the endorsement of the DepEd prior to its final action on HB 1509.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON BASIC EDUCATION AND CULTURE ON 2010-08-02</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
