He is a local leader, inasmuch as he represents the interests of his constituents in the halls of Congress and before departments and agencies the government. However, he is also a national stakeholder and in performing his duties, he is not limited to promoting only parochial concerns but also issues and causes that affect other localities or the entire country as well. With all these concerns on his burden, it is not suprising that the Congressman is, perhaps, the most visited public official, especially when he is in his district, thus this bill. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>UMALI, AURELIO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
