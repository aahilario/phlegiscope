The State resorts to involuntary disappearance to stifle dissent and to silence political activists. While it may no longer be rampant, it remains unbated with not a single case having been resolved. This bill seeks, among others, to adopt the United Nations definition of enforced or involuntary disappearance, to consider involuntary disappearance as a continuing offense as long as the perpetrators continue to conceal the whereabouts of the persons who have disappeared and to disallow time limitation for the prosecution of persons responsible for the commission of involuntary disappearance. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>LAGMAN, EDCELC.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
