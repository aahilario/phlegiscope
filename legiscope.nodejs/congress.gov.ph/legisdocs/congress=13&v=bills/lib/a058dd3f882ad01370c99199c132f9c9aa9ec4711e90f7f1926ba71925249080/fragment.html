Only 37,000 out of the delinquent 96,000 borrowers availed of the condonation package offered under the Housing Loan Condonation Act of 1998. However, because of another surge of financial crisis, the borrowers were still unable to compny with the terms and conditions of their restructured loan agreement. To provide relief to these borrowers until such time that our economic conditions improve, the bill seeks to establish a socialized and low-cost housing loan restructuring program for the next three years from the effectivity of the proposed act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>NOGRALES, PROSPERO C.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
