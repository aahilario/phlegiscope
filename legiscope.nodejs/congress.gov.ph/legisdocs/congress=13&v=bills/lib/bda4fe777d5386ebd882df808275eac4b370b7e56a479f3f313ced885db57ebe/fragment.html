The section also provides that the share of the national government from the community tax collection shall be remitted by the city or municipality concerned within ten (10) days after the end of each quarter. It is silent as when the barangay shall receive its share of the community taxes. To correct the situation, the bill seeks to amend the provision to allow barangays to automatically retain their fifty percent (50%) share in the community tax collections and to remit the share of the city or municipality within ten (10) days after the end of each month.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ANGARA, JUAN EDGARDO M.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
