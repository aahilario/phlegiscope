This law has been critized as unfair and unequal in the treatment of candidates. The proposed bill seeks to declare any elective official, whether national or local, running for any public office than the one which he is holding in a permanent capacity as ipso facto resigned from his office upon the filing of the certificate of candidacy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>NOGRALES, PROSPERO C.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
