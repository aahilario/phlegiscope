There have been reports that the practice has resulted to death or caused facial contusions to patients. To protect and promote the right to health of the people, the bill seeks to limit the practice of cosmetic dermatology to licensed and qualified physicians with residency training in dermatology or plastic surgery.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>NOGRALES, PROSPERO C.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
