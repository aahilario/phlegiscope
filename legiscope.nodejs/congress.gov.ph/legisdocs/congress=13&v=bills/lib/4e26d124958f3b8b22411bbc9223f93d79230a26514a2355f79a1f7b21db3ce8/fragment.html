The bill directs every employer to inform his employee, in writing on the first day of his employment and every time a compensable contingency occurs, of the benefits the latter may avail of. The employee should also be informed of the collective bargaining agreements, company policies and practices and employee contracts arising from the employer-employee relationship.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ZUBIRI, JUAN MIGUEL F.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
