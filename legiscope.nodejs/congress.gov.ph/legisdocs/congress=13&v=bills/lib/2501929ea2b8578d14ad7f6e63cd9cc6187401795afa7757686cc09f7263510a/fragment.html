Allowing the entertainment industry to run its own affairs in the deployment of overseas performing artists (OPAs) is tantamount to allowing OPAs to be exploited even more.  This bill aims to put a stop to the exploitation of the OPAs by seeking the repeal of Sections 29 and 30 of said Act and thus give the POEA more teeth in protecting the welfare of OPAs.  </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>DADIVAS, RODRIGUEZ D.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
