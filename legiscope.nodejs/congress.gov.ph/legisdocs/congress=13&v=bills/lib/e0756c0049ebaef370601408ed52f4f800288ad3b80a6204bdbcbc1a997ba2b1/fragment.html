Because the ECC has to be evaluated and approved by the central office in Manila, the issuance of the ECC may take as long as two years. The bill seeks to grant municipal governments, which have immediate access to where the poultry or piggery is operated, the exclusive authority to issue ECCs for the establishment and operation of a poultry or piggery business with a capital investment of not more than one million pesos. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ABAYON, HARLIN CAST</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
