The Philippine music industry has suffered enormously from the onslaught of foreign media giants. 80% of the total music played in the airwaves are imported music. There is a need to increase the airplay of original Pilpino music (OPM) to ensure the survival of our local industry. The bill seeks to require all radio stations with musical format programs to devote at least half of their time to broadcasting OPM. The export potential in the international market for Filipino music would be encouraged with such support from the government.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INFORMATION ON 2004-07-27</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
