To correct the situation, the bill seeks to give the SK a free hand in the administration of its funds by authorizing the release of funds directly to the Sangguniang Barangay provided that the share of the SK shall likewise be released directly to the SK Treasurer.  Releasing the funds directly to the SK give our youth some measure of autonomy that will empower them to implement projects and engage in activities that will build their character, mold them into becoming responsible citizens and equip them with the necessary skills to prepare them for their future role as community leaders. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>MARCOS, IMEE R.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">DATE FILED : 2004-07-01</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">CO-AUTHORS (Journal Entries) :</td></tr><tr><td>1.
